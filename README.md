**Welcome to Team-13's Project : Clowning Around !**

Below I will explain the steps needed for anyone to start development on our game.
        
1.) Clone the repository



2.) Install Unity if needed here : https://unity.com/download 



3.) Download Unity version 3.7 (3.8 is the newest, but we have been developing on 3.7)




4.) In the Unity Hub, go to the "add" dropdown on the top right. Select "add project from disk" Go to the location of your repository 
  in your files and click add project at the bottom right.



5.) The project will be added to your Unity Home Screen. Double click it to launch the project, you will need to install the Unity Editor
  in order to open the project. Install this editor and you should be good to go. Make sure to have an IDE such as VScode installed in order to view our scripts if needed.
  

**Details of our repository**



The assets folder is where most of our project's important data is kept. It contains our sprites, animations, map assets, backgrounds, scenes, and scripts. To look at our 
code, just got to the scripts folder under assets in the repository. Here there are scripts that run the functionality of many parts of our game such as : the menus,
HUDs, BattleSystem, Player Specifications, Player movement, Scene Loading, etc. Our scripts are commented to help any newcomers understand what different parts of the code actually does. The TextMeshPro folder holds the files for any of our fonts, shaders, and other resources.
